## **üñºÔ∏è Impact Narrative (TODO)**

**Answer the relevant questions below based on your competition:**

**AJL challenge:**

As Dr. Randi mentioned in her challenge overview, ‚ÄúThrough poetry, art, and storytelling, you can reach others who might not know enough to understand what‚Äôs happening with the machine learning model or data visualizations, but might still be heavily impacted by this kind of work.‚Äù
As you answer the questions below, consider using not only text, but also illustrations, annotated visualizations, poetry, or other creative techniques to make your work accessible to a wider audience.
Check out [this guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kYKaVNR\_l7Abx2kebs3AdDi6TlPviC3q/view) from the Algorithmic Justice League for inspiration!

1. What steps did you take to address [model fairness](https://haas.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/What-is-fairness_-EGAL2.pdf)? (e.g., leveraging data augmentation techniques to account for training dataset imbalances; using a validation set to assess model performance across different skin tones)
2. What broader impact could your work have?

## **üöÄ Next Steps & Future Improvements (TODO)**

**Address the following:**

* What are some of the limitations of your model?
* What would you do differently with more time/resources?
* What additional datasets or techniques would you explore?

---

## **üìÑ References & Additional Resources (TODO)**

* Cite any relevant papers, articles, or tools used in your project
